# Fashion MNIST Classification Project

This project demonstrates how to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main sections:
1. Importing libraries and modules
2. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
3. Building and training the neural network
4. Evaluating the model
5. Making predictions and visualizing results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the code
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
```
jupyter notebook AI_Project.ipynb
```
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Fashion MNIST, which can be automatically downloaded via TensorFlow.
